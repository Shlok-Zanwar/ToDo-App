A modified todo List to learn reactjs
Consists of 3 columns
  * Todos
  * Doing
  * Done
  
The app uses local-storage for storing details so that all the todos are retained when page reopens / reloads. <br />
You can also Drag and Drop your todo's to the other divisions rather than using the button.
